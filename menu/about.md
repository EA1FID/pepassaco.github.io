Hello.

I am Pablo Álvarez, Ham radio operator (EA4HFV), Telecommunication Engineering student and hobbyist. As a contributor to the _Maker_ community, I really enjoy making _weekend projects_ related to communications, electronics, RF, antennas, satellites, microwaves...

### About this website

After some years developping some projects during my free time, I decided to share them with the rest of the World in this website, so that I can help other people with my personal experience, provinding guides or ideas for future projects. 

Feel free to share or comment any of my posts if you find them useful. Remeber to cite their original source if you intend to use them in other publications unaffiliated with this website. 

### Professional formation

I completed my elementary education at the IES Fortuny (Madrid). Afterwards, I started a degree in Telecommunication Technologies and Services Engineering, at the Universidad Politécnica de Madrid ([UPM](https://www.etsit.upm.es/estudios/grado-en-ingenieria-de-tecnologias-y-servicios-de-telecomunicacion.html)). 

Right now, I find myself at the last year of the degree, studying the Signals and Systems specialization.

I have been getting some images both from NOAA and Meteor satellites during the last days. While I have achived some pretty good receptions, I tend to loose the signal at relatively high elevations (around 20/20 degrees). In an attempt to improve this, I decided to design my own filters to try to lower the noise level and other interferences at the frequencies of interest. 

In an effort to approach this project the most professional way, I decided to design my own PCBs with discrete SMD components.

## First desing

As I already covered in an older entry, I tend to use Matlab when I want to design a filter. However, with discrete components filters, one big problem arises: you will find that matlab outputs some values of capacitances and inductances that do not match any standard value. If you want a quick and easy alternative, I highly recommend you using some software or website such as [this one](https://rf-tools.com/lc-filter/) that includes the option of selecting the most similar filter with only E24 values. 

The first filter I tried to build is a lowpass filter, since there are some cell phone towers next to my satellite station which can cause problem with the reception. Its specs are:

  - Chebyshev lowpass filter
  - 3rd order
  - 145MHz cutoff frequency
  - 2dB passband ripple
  - 30dB stopband attenuation

After a theoretical design, I proceeded to simulate it in LTSpice, to ensure it would work in reality. This is the final schematic:

## Second design

In this case, I designed a high pass filter, to try to lower the noise caused by FM broadcast signals. Its caracteristics are:

  - Chebyshev highpass filter
  - 9th order
  - 130MHz cutoff frequency
  - 0,2dB passband ripple

The following steps are identical for both filters, so they won0t be separed into different sections


## PCB Desing

In order to design the PCB, we must first choose the typ of line of transmission we want to use. In my case, I went for a microstrip due to its simplicity. 

I will be using FR4, which has a relative dielectric constant $\epsilon_r$ of around 4,7, and my board will be around 1.2mm thick. Moreover, I want the impedance $Z_o$ of the line to be 50Ohm. Hence, the width of the microstrip should be around 2,18mm. 

All components will be SMD, with sizes varying between 0805 and 0603. 

Once we have decided these previous parameters, it is time to actually design the printed circuit board. I will be using KiCAD, due to its simplicity and the fact that it is open software. 

The first step is designing the schematic of the circuit. For that, simply copy the schematic you obtained from your filter designer tool. Once you have finished, choose the corresponding footprint for each component. 

Then, it is time to design the PCB. As it is a RF circuit, it is important to take caution. Add the microstrip, with all the components the closest to it possible and perpendicular between them. Then, add the two connectors and fill the rest of the board with ground planes. remember to add lots os bias to connects GND from both layers.

This is one of the final results:

## Build

Once the PCBs and the components arrives, the only thing left was soldering. Since both the 0805 and 0603 components are big, it is easy to handsolder them.

## Measure 

Unfortunately, I did not have access to any professional equipment to make the measurements. I then bought a BG7TBL white noise source, and downloaded an app called [spektrum](https://github.com/pavels/spektrum), which transforms and SDR into a spectrum analyser.

Once you open the app, connect the Noise source and let calibate it, so that the global frequency response of the system is constant. Then, connect the filter and look at its frequency response. This was the result I obtained:

Low Pass           |  High Pass

The results obtained with these measurements were in fact better than  what I expected.

## Results

Including these two filters to my setup definitely improved satellite reception a lot. Now, I can consistently receive passes without almost any noise starting around 10º of elevation.

This is the final frequency response of both filters together:

And here the receiver chain with an LNA:

Note that I placed the high pass filter before the amplifyer to prevent it from getting saturated.

**Note**: You may be asking yourself *"Why a highpass and a lowpass instead of a bandpass?"* Well, in fact, my first plan was designing a bandpass filter. However, due to some problem with the components I bought, I could not get it working, so I decided to reuse the PCBs and components I already had to design a lowpass filter and afterwards make a new highpass. This is the reason why the images of the lowpass filter in this entry in fact reflect the topology of a bandpass filter.

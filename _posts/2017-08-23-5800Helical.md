The more time I spend flying drones, the further away I want to go with my drone. However, in order to achieve a reliable long run flight, it is extremely important to check wether your *technological capabilities* allow you to do so.

The three main concerns for doing long range FPV are:

- Batteries: you must ensure that they have enought capacity for reaching the goal you want to achieve. Moreover, you must take into account that the more capacity they have, the more they weight.
- Taranis link: a bad communication  between the drone and the Taranis will result in a failsafe. One good way to avoid this is using lower frequencies (namely 900MHz) instead of the stock 2.4GHz.
- FPV link: again, using frequencies lower than 5.8GHz would be the best. However, replacing a stock patch/cloverleaf/pagoda antenna with a more directional one can increase a lot your range

I already have good batteries and a 900MHz TX/RX for my Taranis, so the only issue I had to solve was the FPV link. In order to do that, I decided that a good starting point would be making a directional antenna.

## Helical antennas

I needed a directional antenna with Circular Polarization (CP). This is because using Linear Polarizarion can result in losses of signal when turning around your drone in the air. One antenna that satisfies these requirements is the [Helical antenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helical_antenna) (axial mode).

Helical antennas have long been studied: there are plenty of papers around with lots of information about them (theoretical information, simulations, measurements, etc.). After reading [some papers](http://pwp.gatech.edu/ece-alenka/wp-content/uploads/sites/463/2015/06/Helix_EuCAP_07.pdf) and finding some [other members](https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?1377791-Circularly-Polarized-Helical-antenna-7-5-13-dbi-New-Wave-Trap-match%21) of the community who had already obtained good results with these antennas, I started building my own.

If you are too lazy for making the calculations by yourself, you can either use Matlab's Antenna Toolbox or [online calculators](http://jcoppens.com/ant/helix/calc.en.php) to get the correct measures. Take into account that if you pretend using a PVC pipe as the inner tube, these measures can
vary, since PCV acts as a dielectric.

## Materials

For this project, you will only need:

- PVC pipe
- Thin copper tubing or a thick wire
- Metal surface (for the reflector)
- Small can
- Coax cable (up to at least 6GHz)
- SMA connector

## Build

This process is completely straightforward: first, bend the copper tubing around the PCV and fix it with some hot glue. Then, attach the reflector to the base and solder the coax wire. Finally, cut a strip of can in order to make the impedance adapter and solder it to the base of the antenna.

You're done!

## Results

The firsts results indicate that this antenna can achieve great distances with little power. I was able to get a clear video signal with 50mW from more than 1Km away.

I will continue testing it, and, hopefully, start making some long range flights soon.

Since I was a little kid, I have always been fascinated by satellites, deep space communications and radioastronomy. Who doesn't get impressed when looking at a 70-meter parabolic reflector from underneath? Being able of transfering enormous ammounts of data between tho devices seppared by thousands or even millions of kilometers is one of the biggest achievements of humanity. 

However, in order to get started in spacial communications, it is mandatory to begin from the base. this is how I got to know about NOAA satellites, while learning terms that were previously totally unknown for me, such as SDR or LEO satellite at the same time. 

In a nutsell, my objective for this 2019 summer was being able to receive images from the LEO meteorological satellites NOAA 15, 18 and 19!

## What is this all about?

NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) is an american organisation which has sent lots of different satellites to space since long time ago (middle of the last century). The mission of these satellites is aquiring all type of different data that can then be used for metheorological, climatological or environmental purposes. 

Some of these satellites are orbiting around the Earth at around 800Km of attitude. They are called LEO (Low Earth Orbit) satellites. In the case of NOAA's LEO satellites, they have one great peculiarity: they are continuously takin images of Earth's crust and sending them by using a protocol called APT (Automatic Picture Transmission). Moreover, they use both a frequency (VHF) and a power (around 5W) which makes them pretty easy to receive from Earth, turning them into a good starting point to get into the world of spatial communications.

Roughtly speaking and without entering in much detail, the APT protocol is an analog protocol where the color of each pixel is coded by sending a tone on a specific frequency. Every time the satellite moves a certain distance, it scans a new line of the image, which gets coded using this protocol and transmitted. The fact that these satellites uses a lot of power and a relatively low frequency (sub GHz), allows us to receive pretty good images by using simple omnidirectoinal anntenae and an SDR (Software Defined Radio, a device that basycally consists on a downconverter, ADC sampler and encoder to USB).

## Hardware

The only hardware needed for this project is a DIY RHCP antenna tuned to 137MHz (50Ohm impedance) and an SDR. For the antenna, you can choose between a vast variety of models (e.g: turnstile, eggbeater, QFH, Double-Cross, V-dipole...). In my case, I went for the Double-Cross antenna, which is basically four dipoles with 90º of phase shifting between two of them. For detailed information about how to build one, see [this](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/1364/1/012059/pdf) or [this other](https://www.qsl.net/py4zbz/DCA.pdf) interesting papers. 



In my personal case, for a simple and cheap double-cross antenna, I just needed:

  - Some copper tubing
  - Some PCV pipes
  - An *X* piede to join the PVC pipes
  - A bigger tube for the mast
  - 50Ohm Coax cable (cheap RG-58)
  - SMA connector
  - Ferrite beads (they act as baluns and help reduce noise)

And this is the result after finishing the build:

At the time of choosing the SDR, I decided to go for a cheap R820T2 SDR, which costs about 20€ and can get the job done.

## Software

If yoou are using Windows and do not get to complicate yourself a lot, I would suggest you using the following programs:

  - [Orbitron](http://www.stoff.pl/): satellite tracking software, needed for Doppler correction.
  - [SDR#](https://airspy.com/download/): main software for receiving signals from the SDR.
  - [Tracking DDE Client plugin](http://rtl-sdr.ru/uploads/download/ddetracker.zip): plugin for SDR# that can read data from Orbitron and tune the frequency deppending on the Doppler effect.
  - [WxtoImg](https://wxtoimgrestored.xyz/): decoding software, for transforming the demodulated signal into an image.
  - [VBCable](https://www.vb-audio.com/Cable/): audio pipe to connect SDR# to WxtoImg.

## Setting everything up

In order to set everything up, we must start with the software. I will not cover this part in detail, since you can find pretty good [guides](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/rtl-sdr-tutorial-receiving-noaa-weather-satellite-images/) arount the Internet. Basically, you must configure Orbitron with your location and update its TLEs, tell him where you have installed the DDE plugin and choose the satellites you want to track and their frequency, configure SDR# for your SDR dongle and for the DDE plugin to take control of the frequency when the satellite is overhead, select VBCable as your audio output and, on WxtoImg, set VBCable as the main input. 

With respect to the hardware, there are a few important things to take into account. Firts, you must try this outside: the further away from buildings and other sources of EMI (Electro Magnetic Interference), the better. If you are using any kind of USB extension cable, make sure it is well shielded to avoid interferences. Moreover, gereally, the higher you place the antenna, the better. Besides, the longer the coax line between your antenna and the SDR, the better.

## Received images

After some failed tests mainly due to interferences (mobile phones, bad USB cables and bad locations) and mistaken software settings, these are the first images I was able to take from the satellites:

A couple of images about how the APT signal looks like in the spectrum:

And here my best picture as of now after some minor adjustements (mainly finding sources of noise or interference and removing them or turning them off and changing my location):

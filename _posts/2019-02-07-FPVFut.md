Many hours of foosball at the University later, a new idea came to my mind: what does it feel being a foosball player?

## The idea

In the search for an answer to this question, I had the idea of using a tiny camera with a VTX to attached to a player's head to transmit what he is seeing to some FPV goggles.

This may seem a good idea. However, during the implementation, we found two big unavoidable problems. On the one hand, if we place the camera at a player's chest, we won't be able to see the ball when we have it on our feet. The only solution to this would be placing the camera at a certain angle looking downwards, which eventually resulted in not seeing the rest of the field. Placing the camera at the height of the knees was neither an option, since the risk of the lens being broken by a high speed shoot was incredibly high.

On the other hand, I realised that, while the camera is facing forwards most of the time, at the time you kick the ball, it ends up pointing to the ceiling, which is a bit unpleasant to see in first person and disorientate a lot. There is no easy fix to this issue, but playing for hours with the FPV system helped getting used to it.

In order to lower the importance of these two problems, I decided to set the FPV transmitter and camera to a goalie. In this way, you avoid having to look upwards continuously (it barely shoots the ball fast) and loosing the possession due to not seeing the ball on your feet (again, the goalie tends not to have the possession of the ball).

I had to face some other minor problems, such as placing the battery (which ended up being tied to the bar) and the VTX (which was placed on the player's back as if it were a backpack).

## Hardware

For such a simple project, I used:

- Analog camera
- Simple Eachine TX805 VTX 
- 2S small Li-Po Battery
- FPV goggles

## Results

At first, it seemed completely impossible to coordinate your arm with what you were seeing in order to play foosball decently. However, after some hours of training, most of the people who were playing started getting used to it and consistently intercepting shoots with the goalie. 

It is pretty fin to play like this, as it gives you a totally new perspective of the game. It would be pretty cool to make the adjustements needed to play FPV Foosball not only with the goalie. Who knows, maybe this is the future of such a classic game!

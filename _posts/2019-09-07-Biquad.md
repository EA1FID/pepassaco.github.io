This will be a short post where I describe how I built my most recent antenna: a biquad tuned to 1700MHz. It is mean to be a dish feed, used fot some L band communications

## The biquad antenna

The biquad antenna is a linear polarization directive antenna. During the last years, it has become popular due to its use as a WiFi range extender (either the biquad alone or acting as a feed for a parabolic reflector). They offer much more gain than a single dipole with a reflector but they are not sufficiently directive as for causing underillumination of a dish. Hence, a biquad antenna is a good candidate for becoming part of my L band satellite station (it will have to compete versus the classical $\frac{3}{4}\lambda$ cantenna feed).

You can see its radiation pattern in the following image, taken from [here](wireless.ictp.it):

## Build

In order to get the correct measures, once again, you can use either Matlab (by using its Antenna Toolbox) or some online tool such as [this one](https://buildyourownantenna.blogspot.com/2014/07/double-biquad-antenna-calculator.html) or [this other one](https://www.changpuak.ch/electronics/bi_quad_antenna_designer.php).

These are the materials I used:

  - A one sided copper PCB (reflector, I would recommend using any cheaper metal plate)
  - 2.5mm or thicker wire
  - 12mm copper tubing
  - RG-58 coax

Once you have everything ready, start by giving the wire the shape you want. Make sure that every leg of each square measures the length you have previously calculated. 

Then, cut a little piece in a *C* shape on one end the copper pipe (see the pictures) in order to make soldering earier. Nex, you have to drill the reflector and insert the copper tube throught it.

Finally, introduce the coax inside the copper tube and solder everything together (on the one hand, wire, coax and tube, and, on the other hand, copper pipe to reflector).

## Final result

This is how the antenna looks once everything is finished:

**Note**: this antenna shotcircuits both conductors of the coax. be aware of this and disable or remove any Bias-T you have in your system before pluggin it.

Unfortunately, I do not have any equipment to test it performance at home. I will try to point at some L-band GEO satellites and see how well it performs and tweek a bit some details in order to obtain the best results possible.

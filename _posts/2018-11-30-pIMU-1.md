These last days I've been working on a simple way to track movement and physical activity. After analysing the different options, I reached the conclusion that using an IMU connected to some kind of radio to transmit data would be the best option.

## The plan

I am a canoeist. Most of the time, I train alone, so there is no trainer to follow me and track important parameters such as my paddleling frequency, attacking angle or speed. As such, one day I thought that it would be a great idea to desing some sort of device that could measure all these magnitudes, send them to a *central node* and process the data to obtain the information I want. Nevertheless, such a device would be able to track every type of motion (not only the one of a canoeist), so applying simple changes in the signal processing stage, it could be used for almost any other imaginable application.

The software I developed in this fir is intended to be optimised for tracking the movement of a canoe during a normal training: I designed some filters and used
signal processing tools specifically for our paddleling frequency (between 0.7Hz and 1.3Hz). Anyways, it is easy to adapt the script for other uses.

## Hardware

As this is a prototype, everything will be based on THT boards connected to a protoboard. The main hardware of the portable unit includes:

- Arduino nano
- NRF24L01 module
- LIS3DH IMU
- 1S Li-Po Battery 
- Voltage regulator

On the receiver side, the hardware will jus be:

- Arduino Mega
- NRF24L01

## Firmware

**pIMU side**: For these first tests, I will not dig deeply into the registers of either the LIS3DH or the Atmega328p (I plan on writing a second post with an optimised firmware). However, after reading the datasheets in detail, I introduced a power saving techniques of options in order to increase its battery life:

- Sleep the Atmega328p between measurements and wake it up by using the WDT interruption.
- Reduce LIS3DH's sampling frequency and accuracy (ODR register, selecting Low-Power mode at 25Hz)
- Using SPI instead of I2C
- Enabling low power mode on the NRF24L01 and sleeping the module between samples

**Central node**: As this is just the first version of the prototype, I did not include any power saving options (this arduino is meant to be connected directly to a PC to plot the data in real time). 

In spite of that, it is in this module that the signal is processed in order to remove any unwanted noise and retrieve the information we want. The pIMU just outputs raw data values, which can be seen in the following image:

In order to get useful dara such as paddleling frequency, we must first apply a filter to the signal. For this, we will only use the information from the accelerometer, since during a normal training a canoe does not rotate that much as for showing significant changes in the gyroscope measurements. 

Since a canoeist usually paddles at frequencies lower than 1.3Hz, we must apply a low pass filter to the signal to get rid of high frequency noise. To desing the filter, I used matlab. The settings I chose were:

- Elliptic low pass filter
- 40dB stopband attenuation 
- 0.5dB passband ripple
- 25Hz sampling frequency

Matlab will return two vectors *[a b]*, which correspond to the coefficients of the filter of order *k*:

$$\displaystyle H(z) = \frac{Y(z)}{X(z)} = \frac{b_0+b_1z^{-1}+...+b_kz^{-k}}{a_0+a_1z^{-1}+...+a_kz^{-k}}$$

In order to implement this filter in our program, we must just solve for y[n] undoing the z-transform:

$$\displaystyle a_0y[n] + a_1y[n-1] + ... + a_ky[n-k] = b_0x[n] +b_1x[n-1]+...+b_kx[n-k]$$

$$\displaystyle y[n] = \frac{1}{a_0} \left( b_0x[n] +b_1x[n-1]+...+b_kx[n-k] - a_1y[n-1] - ... - a_ky[n-k]\right)$$

In the following image, you can see our original signal after being filtered by the low pass filter we have just designed:

For last, we must desing the frequency counter. For that, one option is implementing a comparator with hysteresis. It may not be the easiest or most intuitive approach, but it is one of the most trustworthy. With the comparator, we detect each of the single strokes and add them to a buffer. This buffer will be 8s long (200 samples) with an overlap of 4 seconds (100 samples). In this way, we can determine with enought precision the average stroke frequency of the last 8 seconds with an update interval of only 4s.

## Conclusion

This project was a complete success and opened a whole new world of possibilities. I plan on making improvements and adding some new functionalities to it, such as desingning a PCB, lowering the overall power consumption or even desinging an Android app in order to plot and record live data directly from a smartphone.

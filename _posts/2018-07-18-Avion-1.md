As I stated in a previous post, I always loved planes and aerodynamics. If I had not built any RC plan until now, it was because I found myself without any experience in this field and without any *easy* way to get started.

However, this month, I decided that I was already prepared to try something new. After reading lots of webpages with information and calculations about airplane modeling, I finally dared to build my own RC plane. Specifically, I planned on taking a glider toy and adding some ailerons, servos, motor and electronics to it.

## Bill of materials

- Glider
- Brushless motor
- Propeller
- Flisht Controller
- ESC
- Taranis RX
- Servomotors
- Foam
- Li-Po Battery

Optional:

- FPV Camera
- VTX

## Choosing the right components

This is the most difficult part of the whole process, since there is no *universal* choice (your components will depend on the glider you chose). In my case, the glider had the following specs:

-  510g all up weight (with electronics and battery)
-  86cm wingspan
-  1280cm^2 wing surface

A good point to start from is using the following website called [webocalc](https://web.archive.org/web/20160920044337/http://flbeagle.rchomepage.com:80/software/webocalc_1.7.6/html/webocalc_metric.html). There, you can find information about the kv's of the motor, the propeller and almost any other mechanical aspect of the plane you need.

Regarding the electronics, I would suggest choosing a high current ESC (>30A) and a cheap FC (it is not as critical as in a racing drone)

## Build

This was not an easy step either, but, with enought patience, everything ended up going well.

Once again, this step depends on the glider you chose. Nevertheless, I would suggest looking at some DIY RC Planes [videos](https://youtu.be/cD2Ca2oskVs) on YouTube in order to get a general idea about how they are done.

## Testing

**Note:** *before testing your plane, I highly recommend practicing some 3rd/1st person view flights on a simulator. Otherwise, you risk having a crash during the first few seconds of flight and destroying your model (as it happened to me).*

In spite of only being able to do a single test, I would consider the project a complete success: the plane lifted off without any inconvenience and was very responsible when in the air.

Some first person view images (note the distorsion caused by the heavy vibrations of the motor):

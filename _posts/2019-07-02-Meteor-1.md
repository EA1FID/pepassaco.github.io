the reception of images from the NOAA satellites was a complete success. However, I did not want to stop there: there are plenty of other meteorological satellites continuously transmitting images from space, and I wanted to be able to obtain those other images. Moreover, APT is quite an old protocol (more than 50 years old) and is completely analog.

After looking for some information on the Internet, I decided my next objective: receiving images from the Meteor M N-2 satellite.

## The satellite

The Meteor M2 N-2 is a Russian meteorological satellite. It also transmits on VHF (137MHz) with good power, so its signal can be received with the same setup we used fot the NOAA satellites. Nevertherless, there is a huge difference between these sateliites and the Meteor: this last one uses a different protocol to APT. It is called LRPT (Low-Rate Picture Transmission), and it is a **digital** protocol! This allows it to send higher resolution images and applying error correction techniques at the receiver side.

The signal sent by the satellite is a QPSK modulation with Gray enconding, at a rate of 72kbaud. During the reception of the emission, you can see both the constellation and the eye diagram of the received signal, in order to check the quality of the recived signal.

## Upgrading the setup for Meteor M N-2

As I said before, this satellite transmits on the same frequency and polarization as NOAA's APT. In this way, we can use the same antenna we built in the last entry of the web. However, we must adapt out software for decoding this new satellite. For an extensive guide about how to do this, check this [website](http://happysat.nl/Setup_Meteor/Setup.html).

We will need two new pieces of software:
  - [Meteor demodulator plugin](http://happysat.nl/meteor_2.3.zip): it demodulates the signal and outputs both a raw data file and data to a TCP socket.
  - [LRPT decoder](http://happysat.nl/LRPT_Decoder_v56.zip): it takes as input the raw data and outputs the final image.
  - [LRPT Image processor](https://www.satsignal.eu/software/LRPT-processor.html): geometry correction software
  
Again, this is Windows-only software. I plan on automating the reception of these satellites in a linux machine in a near future, after which I would write a new post.

## Tests and results

At first, it seemed to me more difficult to obtain a good image from this satellite than from NOAAs. These are the first images I was able to capture:

And, here, some examples of the singal itself:

For last, these are the best images I was able to retrieve from Meteor M2 up to date:

Looking forward to optimising my setup and getting rid of those annoying lines on the picture!
